# WhoDroppedTheDB
A database made in C for ESGI
Made With Love by Kevin COUPY 3SI3 :)

I choosed to create a program for the Pacifica Standard bank to manage customers and accounts.
Each user have a/multiple related account.
Recently an intern has joined the team so I had some disk persistency if the DB has to be deleted by error :)

To run the project, just type "make run" in a terminal !

## TODO
### Maintainability
- Do multiple error function checks to reduce code
- Add binary tree 
- Define Makefile flags utility

### User experience
- Automatic creation of a new DB while the current DB is dropped (Actually you have to restart the program to get a new DB


### Functionnality
- Add customer account view while selecting "View account" in the customer selection menu
- Add modification and deletion function for accounts
- Add shared accounts
- Add money transfer
